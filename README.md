#### Gender inequities in science go beyond disparities in scientific prominence, extending to visibility in public domains. Public scientists wield considerable power over what the public sees, reads, and understands about science, yet we know little about the presence of men and women scientists in different types of media. Longitudinal analyses of all Dutch full professors show that women scientists are underrepresented in printed news. Although women and men full professors are equally present in online news and social media, women full professors are mentioned by name less on these platforms. While women full professors’ representation online is encouraging, persistent underrepresentation in printed news perpetuates gendered perceptions of science by the public, hindering women scientists’ careers and limiting their influence.
